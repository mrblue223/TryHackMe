## TryHackMe CTF Write-ups

This repository is a comprehensive collection of detailed write-ups and solutions for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from the TryHackMe platform.
About This Repository

It meticulously documents the methodologies, specific commands, and vulnerabilities exploited to compromise various machines. Each write-up covers the entire process, from initial reconnaissance and gaining an initial foothold to lateral movement and escalating privileges to root.
What You'll Find Here

    Step-by-step guides: Clear, actionable instructions for every phase of the attack.
    Command specifics: All commands used, with explanations of their purpose.
    Tool rationale: Insights into why specific tools were chosen and how they were applied.
    Vulnerability explanations: Detailed breakdowns of the exploited weaknesses.
    Post-exploitation techniques: Methods for persistence, data exfiltration, and further enumeration.

## How to Navigate

Write-ups are organized by the name of the TryHackMe machine. Each machine's directory typically contains its respective README.md with the full write-up, along with any necessary scripts or files used during the compromise.
For Learners

This repository is designed as a learning resource. While you can find solutions here, the primary goal is to help you understand the why and how behind each step in a penetration test. We encourage you to try solving the machines yourself first, then use these write-ups to compare your approach, learn new techniques, or overcome hurdles.
